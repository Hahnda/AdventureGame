"""
This is a python based game which is a spoof of the King Arthur and Holy Grail stories.
There is decision making, randomness, and risk of death.
This game takes places in a fictional world containing geographic and topological features. (hills, mountains, rivers, lake, etc.)
I hope you enjoy it. Good luck and God speed!

(i am editing this line via github.)
